Today I made a bootable usb drive by downloading the Linux ubuntu ISO in that and the running it on my machine (laptop).
The very next task was to install the lamp on the linux ubuntu and hosting a localhost asthe test result, this was initially giving some problems in the installation.but then at last was just able to run all the commands fro teh installation and the problem then came was to host it locally some commands which were optional of the php were also executed by me.
