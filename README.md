### Day-1 (29-7-2022)
Today is my first day of traning in SDC. I was window user but here is mandatory to work on `Linux`. So i have put the `Linux` in my laptop. All training members are talking about `frappe` which i never heard before. From them i got some idea aboout the `frappe` framework and read some little bit documentation of `frappe`.

### Day-2 (30-7-2022)
Today I made a bootable usb drive by downloading the Linux ubuntu ISO in that and the running it on my machine (laptop).
The very next task was to install the lamp on the linux ubuntu and hosting a localhost asthe test result, this was initially giving some problems in the installation.but then at last was just able to run all the commands fro teh installation and the problem then came was to host it locally some commands which were optional of the php were also executed by me.
when there was any problem in the execution of any command I refer to Stackoverflow site https://stackoverflow.com/ to find the aulternative command.

### Day-3 (1-8-2022)

### Day-4 (2-8-2022)
Went on to the frappe framework offficial page and headed with the installation process and kept on recovering the erros.
This activity took about 2 days.then we found another souces fro teh installation of the framework because theh version of the linux was not compactable with the official instructions.
The then used instructionn manual was(https://github.com/D-codE-Hub/Guide-to-Install-Frappe-ERPNext-in-Ubuntu-22.04-LTS) for the proper installation of the later.
